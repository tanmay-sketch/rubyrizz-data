The dataset includes 293 images.
R-B-G-O-Y-W are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit within)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random shear of between -5째 to +5째 horizontally and -5째 to +5째 vertically
